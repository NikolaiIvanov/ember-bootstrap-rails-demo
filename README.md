# Welcome to Ember Bootstrap Rails Demo app

This app will demonstrate using [ember-bootstrap-rails](https://github.com/kristianmandrup/ember-bootstrap-rails)

The application will be built almost entirely using the bootstrap helpers.

The top bar will contain a menu where you can navigate to each page, demonstrating the various bootstrap Views and Handlebars helpers.

## Important

Please help out with this demo app and the [ember-bootstrap-rails](https://github.com/kristianmandrup/ember-bootstrap-rails) library!

Fork it, fix/improve it and make a pull request :)

Thanks!
